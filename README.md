PHDS Graduate Workshop: Implementing open science
================
Jonas Sch√∂ley

We will learn how to set-up a demographic research project in a way that is easily reproducible and confirms to the standards of open science by making research artifacts openly available, accessible and reusable for everyone. Working through real research projects, we get familiar with the tools of the open science trade: Preprint-servers, code and data repositories, and version control systems. We introduce best-practices on how to use these tools and how to structure multi-author research projects such that they can be easily shared.
